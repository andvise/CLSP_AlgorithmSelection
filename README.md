# Algorithm Selection Approach for the Capacitated Lot Sizing Problem

## Introduction
This repository contains code and dataset for algorithm selection for the Capacitated Lot Sizing Problem presented in the following publication:
* Visentin, Andrea, et al. "Explainable Algorithm Selection for the Capacitated Lot Sizing Problem." The 21st International Conference on the Integration of Constraint Programming, Artificial Intelligence,
and Operations Research (2024).

## Structure
The structure of the repository is organised as follows:
* **analysis.ipynb** - contains the Python code for data preprocessing, ML comparison, algorithm selection, feature selection and explainability.
* **datasets/df_CLSP.csv** - contains the data relative to the dataset containing small instances.
* **datasets/df_large.csv** - contains the data relative to the dataset containing large instances.
